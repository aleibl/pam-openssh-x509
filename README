Introduction
------------

pam_openssh_x509 is a collection of PAM modules that paired with a PKI
provides a fully automatized solution for the management of OpenSSH keys.

pam_openssh_x509 enables you to...

 * reduce your costs yet improving security by using synergies of already
   established processes
 * centrally manage access to OpenSSH Servers
 * raise the security level of OpenSSH keys to the same as x509 certificates
 * highly protect private keys by using Smartcard technology
 * periodically update key material without manual interaction
 * revoke keys in a standard way
 * gain back control of the key creation process
 * be completeley independent of changes to OpenSSH itself by using a long
   established and supported standard interface
 * simply implement 2 factor authentication
 * adopt to different environments by the usage of policies
 * reveal the theft of private keys and making it hard to duplicate them
 * KEEP IT SIMPLE \o/

For more information on how to make the most out of pam_openssh_x509 see
next section.


Operating Model
---------------

The idea behind pam_openssh_x509 is to make managed x509 certificates accessible
for OpenSSH Public key authentication. Contrary to other approaches the Source
Code of OpenSSH wont be altered making it sort of independent from changes to
OpenSSH. Also it supports components usually found in larger enterprises
creating an integrated solution for OpenSSH key management. It therefore prevents
the installation and maintenance of a whole new bloated software for managing
OpenSSH key material yet raising the security level of the keys and reducing costs.

The Operating Model consists of the following components:

 * PKI
 * LDAP Server
 * Smartcard technology (optional)
 * SSH Client supporting Smartcards (e.g. PuTTY-CAC) (optional)
 * pam_openssh_x509

The tasks of each component is as follows:

The PKI is responsible for the management of the whole lifecycle of x509 certificates

 * create the private key in a secure manner (e.g. make sure that private key will be
   created on Smartcard using a known key creation procedure)
 * re-key in regular intervals
 * maintain processes for key revocation
 * publish x509 certificates to LDAP Server

The LDAP Server

 * stores all x509 certificates
 * maintains a list of all OpenSSH Servers

The Smartcard is used for

 * the generation and storage of the private key
 * authentication

The SSH client supporting Smartcards will

 * use the private key inside the Smartcard to create the digital signature used for
   authentication instead of a private key kept inside the filesystem


For the usage of pam_openssh_x509 the PKI has to store the x509 certificates at the
user object in the LDAP Server. Every OpenSSH Server will be represented as a group
in a distinct tree in the LDAP Server. Access permission to an OpenSSH Server is then
granted through a group membership. pam_openssh_x509 makes sure that the public key
of the x509 certificate is synchronized to the Server after the x509 certificate has
been checked (trusted? valid? not revoked?).


Module Stack
------------

pam_openssh_x509 is made up of the following modules:

pam_openssh_x509_base.so

 * checks access permissions through LDAP groups
 * validates x509 certificate
 * converts public key to OpenSSH key format
 * creates and updates data transfer object passed to further modules with all
   determined information

pam_openssh_x509_audit.so (optional)

 * logs information of data transfer object

pam_openssh_x509_validate.so

 * policy that evaluates data transfer object and updates authorized_keys file


The base file collects all the information but doesnt make any decissions about the update
of the authorized_keys file and thus refers the decission if access shall be granted
or not to downstream modules. The audit module is just a passive component that doesnt
change the data transfer object or make any decission about the update of the authorized_keys
file. The latter decissions are outsourced to the validation module that can be different
for various environments. For example in a testing environment you wouldnt mind if the
certificate is expired or revoked whereas you would in production. Basically the validation
is the only artefact that has to be adjusted to individual needs.
